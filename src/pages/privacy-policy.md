## This site does not collect any personal information

* No cookies are set
* No third-party tracking scripts
* No user analytics or other metrics are processed during your visit
* No server log files, which means your IP address is not stored

## HTTPS out of the box

This site uses HTTPS, encrypting all data between your browser and my server. Your network provider may still be able to see that you are loading files from this site, but will not be able to see their contents. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data e.g. whilst browsing on public WiFi, or network providers attempting to injecting ads into this site. Use HTTPS everywhere.
