## This site does not collect any personal information

* No cookies are set
* No third-party tracking scripts
* No user analytics or other metrics are processed during your visit
* No server log files, which means your IP address is not stored

## HTTPS out of the box

This site uses HTTPS, encrypting all data between your browser and my server. Your network provider may still be able to see that you are loading files from this site, but will not be able to see their contents. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data e.g. whilst browsing on public WiFi, or network providers attempting to injecting ads into this site. Use HTTPS everywhere. 

## Webmentions

This site implements [Webmentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention), a form of content interaction for the web. Other systems may send webmentions to this site, whenever a blog post or note on this site is linked to. This may include:

* Content published on other blogs that contain such a link
* Tweets published on Twitter that contain such a link
* Replies and comments made on a tweet that contains such a link

Incoming webmentions are handled as a request to comment on a piece of content, and may be included on this site. A webmention may include your personal data, provided you have made that data publicly visible on your site or on your social media profile. Webmentions may include:

* Your username (this may be your real name)
* Your profile picture
* The source URL (this may be your own site or the URL to a tweet)
* The content of your comment or reply

The processing of incoming Webmentions is based on legitimate interest to enable interaction with readers of this site (Art. 6(1) lit. f GDPR), following the intented design of the Webmention protocol.

If your personal data is published as a webmention, you may at any time request the removal of it from this site. To do so, please contact me and point me at the entry in question.
